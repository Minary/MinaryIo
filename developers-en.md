Minary is constantly evolving and gaining new features.
The more developers join and contribute code, the faster development will be. We are looking for concrete **contributions in the shape of merge/pull requests** or hints for where to improve, based on _best practices_.

We also value **bug reports** if they include the steps necessary to reproduce the error.

Minary is in beta and contains critical [bugs](https://github.com/Minary/Minary/issues) as well as less fatal issues.

We appreciate any contributions that fix this or that bug!

The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/minary).
