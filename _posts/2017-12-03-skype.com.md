**Target**: skype.com  
**Verified on**: 2017-12-03  
**Verified by**: [Ruben Unteregger](https://twitter.com/rubenunteregger)  
**Verified browser**: Firefox, Chrome  
**Operating system**: Microsoft Windows 7, 10  
**Description**: This template redirects requests sent from the victim system to the Skype web server to a server that is controlled by the attacker. HTTPS/HSTS is circumvented by DNS CNAME redirection.  
**Impact**: The attacker can read the unencrypted data flowing between the victim system and the Skype server. This way the attacker can for example read the login  procedure.
