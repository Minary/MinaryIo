**Description**: This template redirects requests sent from the victim system to the Amazon web server to a server that is controlled by the attacker. HTTPS/HSTS is circumvented by DNS CNAME redirection.  
**Impact**: The attacker can read the unencrypted data flowing between the victim system and the Amazon server. This way the attacker can for example read the login, ordering or payment procedure.
