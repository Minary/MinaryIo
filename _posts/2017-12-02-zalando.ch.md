**Target**: zalando.ch  
**Verified on**: 2017-12-02  
**Verified by**: [Ruben Unteregger](https://twitter.com/rubenunteregger)  
**Description**: This script redirects requests sent from the victim system to the Zalando web server to a server that is controlled by the attacker.  
**Impact**: The attacker can read the unencrypted data flowing between the victim system and the Zalando server. This way the attacker can for example read the login, ordering or payment procedure.
