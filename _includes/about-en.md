## The Minary Project

The Minary project's aim is to raise awareness about the fact that it's not only hackers and totalitarian governments that threaten your privacy. It's enough if you know one nosy person.

The project tries to show that your privacy can be invaded even with **little knowledge**, allowing anyone to gain access to a stranger's most intimate information.

To make this as easy as possible for anyone interested, the project publishes software of the same name.

## The Minary Application 

_Minary_ is the tool of choice for reaching these goals. It shows that little knowledge is required, that two clicks are enough to spy on a system even if it employs encryption. Minary is available from the [download page]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}).
